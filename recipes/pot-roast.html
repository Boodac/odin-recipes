    <img src="images/pot-roast.webp" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A slow cooker pot roast, served with carrots and potatoes.</p>
    <h2>You Will Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Slow Cooker, 7qt+ preferable</li>
        <li>A Cast Iron Pan, at least 10 inches</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A large de-boned chuck roast, at least 2lbs but 3 would be better</li>
        <li>A pound of new potatoes</li>
        <li>A pound of <b>thick</b> baby carrots; petite-cut will not work. You may find thicker baby carrots by purchasing "organic."</li>
        <li>A yellow onion</li>
        <li>24oz Beef Stock</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Worchestershire Sauce</li>
        <li><b>Herbs and Spices</b>: Thyme, Cumin, Rosemary, Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>A Bay Leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat your roast dry, and liberally apply kosher salt to all sides.</li>
        <li>Sear all sides of the chuck roast in your cast iron pan. Just get it ripping hot and it should take about a minute per side.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop an onion, throw it in your slow cooker</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes on top of the onion</li>
        <li>Add the carrots on top of the potatoes</li>
        <li>On the vegetables, sprinkle thyme and rosemary, add a bay leaf, and a few shakes of soy sauce and worchestershire</li>
        <li>Place the beef roast on top of the carrots. Don't bother trying to mix anything in.</li>
        <li>Pour the beef stock over the beef. Stop if it comes halfway up the side of the meat, otherwise add it all. The vegetables and beef will add more liquid.</li>
        <li>Cover the beef with a few sprinkles of cumin.</li>
        <li>Cook on low for 6-8 hours.</li>
    </ol>
