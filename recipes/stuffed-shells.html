    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven tp 350&deg; F</li>
        <li>Bring salted water to a boil. Following your box's directions, prepare your jumbo shells. After they are drained, 
            ensure you rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef, draining any excess fat. Combine it with your marinara (jarred or homemade).</li>
        <li>Prepare the shell filling by combining the ricotta, a few ounces of mozarella, the parmesan, egg, parsley and garlic powder. You may add black powder to taste.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of your baking dish with a small amount of the sauce that you've created.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon and your fingers, fill each shell (careful not to overfill) and place them, opening side up,</li>
        <li>Top the shells with your mozarella, and cover the entire baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 5-10 mminutes, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the shells to rest before eating, so that the cheese filling can set. Serve with basil garnish.</li>
    </ol>
